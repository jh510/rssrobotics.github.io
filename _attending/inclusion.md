The RSS community is committed to increasing the participation of groups
traditionally underrepresented in robotics (including but not limited to:
women, LGBTQ+, underrepresented minorities, and people with disabilities),
especially people early in their studies and career. To that end, RSS is
providing a special workshops-only registration at a reduced rate ($67.50) for
undergraduates who identify as belonging to an underrepresented group.

To obtain the registration code, please email
[rss2017inclusion@gmail.com](mailto:rss2017inclusion@gmail.com) with your name
and institution name. You will then receive a code to use during registration.
To register, go to the registration site and choose  "Student Registration:
Workshop Only"  and apply the registration code. The code is valid until the
registration website closes on July 5th. Note that when you pick up your badge,
you will need to show proof that you are currently an undergraduate student.
