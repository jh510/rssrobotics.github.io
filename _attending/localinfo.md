The conference is located in [Cambridge](http://www.cambridgeusa.org), Massachusetts, in the greater [Boston area](http://www.visitboston.org).

Cambridge is easily accessible from the Boston Logan Airport via the Boston Area subway system, [MBTA](http://www.visitboston.org). Take the Silver Line from the Logan Airport to the South Station, and then take the Red Line from South Station to Kendall/MIT subway station. This trip takes 30 - 40 minutes. Taxis are also available at the airport.
