{% elsif award_name == 'Best Student Paper' %}
### Best Student Paper Award

This award is given to the best paper of the conference whose first author is a
student.

{% elsif award_name == 'Best Systems Paper' %}
### Best Systems Paper Award in Memory of [Seth Teller](http://people.csail.mit.edu/teller/)

This award is given to outstanding systems papers presented at the RSS
conference. The awards committee determines each year if a paper of sufficient
quality is among the accepted papers and may decide not to give the award. In
years when no award is given, the list of finalists will not be disclosed. This
award was given for the first time in 2015
([more information](http://www.roboticsfoundation.org/index.php/awards?id=15)).
