The 2018 {{site.title}} Conference will bring together researchers working on
all aspects of robotics including scientific foundations of robotics, robotics
applications, and analysis of robotic systems. We seek your best work in all
areas of robotics and solicit papers that cover both the “Science” and the
“Systems” of robotics.

The conference will be single-track, and the final program will be the result of
a thorough review process to give attendees an opportunity to see the most
exciting research in all areas of robotics. Submissions will be evaluated in
terms of their novelty, technical quality, significance, potential impact, and
clarity.

The program will include invited talks as well as oral and poster presentations
of refereed papers. The three-day main session will be followed by two days of
workshops and tutorials. Workshop-only registration will also be
available. Every effort is being made to keep conference expenses affordable,
particularly for student attendees.

This year, we are especially excited to showcase the following two themes via
special sessions at the conference:

* **Field Robotics**: Underwater Robotics, Aerial/Space Robotics, Agricultural and Mining Robotics, Building and Construction, Environmental Monitoring
* **Mechanisms, and Design**: Humanoids, Hands, Legged Systems, Snakes, Novel Actuators, Reconfigurable Robots, MEMS/NEMS, Micro/Nanobots, Novel Sensors, Haptics, Tactile Interfaces, Soft Robots, Wearable Robots, Design optimization for robots, Minimal design

## Important Dates

* Full Paper Submission: Thursday, February 1, 2018, Anywhere on Earth
* Paper Notification: April 23, 2018
* Conference Dates: June 26-30, 2018 (Main Conference: June 26-28, Workshops: June 29-30)

## Themes

RSS is actively seeking papers in areas that have not been traditionally represented at the conference and will stay true to its name covering both the “Science” and the “Systems” of robotics. Papers containing original and unpublished work are solicited in all areas of robotics, including (but not limited to) the following themes:

* **Kinematics, Dynamics, and Control:** Dexterous Manipulation, Locomotion, Nonlinear Control, Visual Servoing
* **Mechanisms:** Design, Humanoids, Hands, Legged Systems, Snakes, Novel Actuators, Reconfigurable Robots, MEMS/NEMS, Micro/Nanobots, Novel Sensors, Haptics, Tactile Interfaces
* **Planning and Algorithms:** Motion Planning, Task Planning, Coordination, Complexity and Completeness, Computational Geometry, Simulation, Planning under uncertainty
* **Manipulation:** Contact Modeling, Grasp Synthesis, Assembly, Force Control, Manipulation Planning
* **Human-Robot Interaction and Human Centered Systems:** Brain-Machine Interfaces, Telerobotics, Human Augmentation, Assistive Robots, Social Robots, Safe Interaction, Robots and Art,
Grounded language acquisition, Natural language generation, Human-robot dialogue
* **Field Robotics:** Underwater Robotics, Aerial/Space Robotics, Agricultural and Mining Robotics
* **Formal methods:** Safety, Verification, Validation, Correct-by-construction Systems, Controller Synthesis, Certification
* **Distributed Systems:** Multi-Robot Systems, Networked Robots, Robot Soccer
* **Medical Robotics:** Robot-Assisted Procedures, Smart Surgical Tools, Rehabilitation Robotics, Interventional Therapy, Image-Guided Procedures, Surgical Simulation, Soft-Tissue Modeling, Telesurgery
* **Biological Robotics:** Biomimetic Robotics, Robotic Investigation of Biological Science and Systems, Neurobotics, Prosthetics, Robotics and Molecular Biology
* **Robot Perception:** Vision, Tactile and Force Perception, Range Sensing, Inertial and propreoceptive sensing, Sensor Fusion, Calibration & Identification
* **Mobile Systems and Mobility:** Mapping, Localization, Navigation, SLAM, Collision Avoidance, Exploration
* **Estimation and Learning for Robotic Systems:** Reinforcement Learning, Bayesian Techniques, Deep Learning, Graphical Models, Imitation Learning, Programming by Demonstration, Diagnostics

## Author Information

Submissions may be up to 8 pages in length, excluding references. Reviewing for
RSS 2018 is double-blind, so authors should not be listed on the title page, and
reasonable anonymity should be maintained in the paper. Submissions that are
identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously
published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel
to other conferences are not appropriate for RSS and violate our dual submission
policy; exceptions to this rule are detailed on the author information page on
the RSS 2018 website.

Submissions will be evaluated in terms of their technical quality, novelty,
significance, potential impact, and clarity. All papers accepted for
presentation at the main conference will be published in the online
proceedings. Selected papers will be invited for submission to a special issue
of the International Journal of Robotics Research and a special issue of
Autonomous Robots.

Please visit the [author information]({{site.baseurl}}/information/authorinfo/) page for extensive instructions.

## Special Journal Issues

About _half_ of the selected papers will be invited for submission to a special issue of International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR) and a special issue of Autonomous Robots (AuRo). For example, out of the 57 accepted papers in RSS 2014, 15 appeared in the [IJRR Special Issue](http://ijr.sagepub.com/content/35/1-3.toc), and 13 in the [AuRo Special Issue](http://link.springer.com/journal/10514/39/3/page/1).
